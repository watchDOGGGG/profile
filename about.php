									<h5>Social network</h5>
									<p>
										Due to the recent ban of twitter in my country, i found out we where short of a social platform to express how we feel, i developed a social networking (still on development) <a href="https://palscheck.com">palscheck</a> that allows users share image, videos, and life experience, each feed made creates an automatic group chats for the followers reducing the stress of creating followers group and having to post to it for your followers to see, its also a platform that pays content creators for info uploaded to the site, this payment is done through users subscription, and lots more.
